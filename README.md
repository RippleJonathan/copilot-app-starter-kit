## Autopilot quickstart

Clone this repo, open it in Codespaces or a devcontainer, then use the quickstart prompt from `COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` to ask Copilot Agent to scaffold features from `/templates`.

See `/templates/prompts.md` for copy-paste prompt templates and `/scripts/generate_feature.sh` to instantiate templates locally.

Contributing: see `CONTRIBUTING.md` (not yet added) for how to extend templates and add new feature scaffolds.

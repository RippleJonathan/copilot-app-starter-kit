# Security Policy

If you find a security vulnerability, please report it privately so we can address it promptly.

Preferred reporting options:

- Open a private security advisory on GitHub: https://github.com/RippleJonathan/copilot-app-starter-kit/security/advisories
- Email: security@your-domain.example (replace with a working address)

We will respond to valid reports within 72 hours. Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix or mitigation is available.

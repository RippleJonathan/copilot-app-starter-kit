# Frontend Template

This is a minimal frontend template intended as a starting point for generated apps.

Quickstart (after generation):

```bash
cd generated-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the template smoke test:

```bash
node test.js
```

The template uses Vite + React in `package.json`. You can customize it further as needed.
